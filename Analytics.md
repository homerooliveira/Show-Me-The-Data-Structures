## Problem 1
The time-complexity for this program is `O(1)` because we are using a doubly linked list to add and remove elements and dictonary to find the nodes.

## Problem 2

The time-complexity for this program is `O()`

## Problem 3

The time-complexity for this program is `O()`

## Problem 4

The time-complexity for this program is `O(n ^ k)` because `n`  is the number of groups and `k` is the depth of group.

## Problem 5

The time-complexity for this program is `O(1)` because the `add` method of linked list is `O(1)`.

## Problem 6
